The Diwali Sales Analysis project uses Python to study sales data during Diwali. It cleans and analyzes data to find trends like top-selling products, customer preferences by age and gender, and sales by region. The results help businesses plan better for Diwali, like focusing on popular products and targeting the right customers. This project shows how data analysis can improve sales strategies during festivals.
